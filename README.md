## General Info

This project was created as a task for a college classes. This web application allows you to manage your monthly spending (add, delete). There is also a possibility to compare final sums per year.

## Features

To add new spend you have to fill the form you find on the home page. There are two required values - money, which is the amount of money you have spent, and a category that could summarise the spend. Additionally, you can add a comment and a date. If you do not change the date it will be the current day. 
To submit the form you have to click the button represented by the dollar sign below the form, or just click "enter".
To change the month you have to click the proper dot below the current month name.
